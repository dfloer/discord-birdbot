# Input Parsing Scripts

## `ebird_taxonomy_parse.py`
  
  For parsing the eBird taxonomy CSV obtained from <http://www.birds.cornell.edu/clementschecklist/download/> into common/scientific names and their 4-letter-codes to allow mapping between 4-letter codes and the common, not scientific, name. Outputs mappings in json format to `common.json`, which includes the common name to all 4-letter-codes including the scientific/binomial mapping.

 Currently tested with the 2021 eBird taxonomy (not Clements or combined).

 Uses the rules as given at <https://help.ebird.org/customer/portal/articles/2667298-quick-entry-code-methodology> with some additional behaviour for edge-cases the rules don't include.

### Unspecified Behaviour

- Several entries on eBird don't match their own rules. This code does not replicate this behaviour and instead returns according to the rules.
  - For example, "King-of-Saxony Bird-of-Paradise" is given in the rules (and this code) as producing KOSB and KSBP, but only KOSB produces results in eBird's species search.
- Birds with names that are less than 4 letters long have a code of their whole name.
- There in an alternative rule for dealing with birds that have a hyphen separating the final words of their names. There are several birds with more than one hyphen separating the last words of the name, including a few birds where all of their name is hyphenated. The rule says **a** hyphen, so this code only uses the alternative with one hyphen.
- Further on the previous, there are also bird species that have multiple than one word before the hyphenated part. Only the first word and last hyphenated words are looked at.
  - Examples: Serra do Mar Tyrant-Manakin is SETM. even though the rules are unclear how this is treated.
- For bird names that are over 4 words long when split on hyphens, but 4 or fewer words long when not split on hyphens using the alternative hyphen splitting rule, both forms are returned.
- In addition to the previous, both rules are also applied with the alternate rule for >4 word names with obvious conjunctions omitted (of, and, the).
- Does not represent alternate common names as these are not included in the eBird taxonomy and it is unknown which are supported.

## `banding_code_parse.py`

Parses the banding codes from The Institute for Bird Populations downloaded from: <http://www.birdpop.org/docs/misc/List21.zip>.\
    Writes output to `banding.json` with a mapping from the common name to 4-letter-codes.

## Important Notes

- eBird's common names and the common names used in the banding codes are not always the same name. A significant number of birds do not have banding codes.
- The banding codes exclude non-species, like hybrids, these are excluded from output.
